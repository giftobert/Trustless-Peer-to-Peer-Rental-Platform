# DecentralStay: Trustless Peer-to-Peer Rental Platform

## Project Overview

DecentralStay is an innovative blockchain-powered platform revolutionizing short-term rentals through decentralized technologies. By combining smart contracts, NFT representations, and IoT integration, we create a secure, transparent, and efficient rental ecosystem.

## Key Features

### 1. Smart Contract Booking & Payment
- Escrow-based payment processing
- Automated fund release upon successful check-in
- Transparent fee structure
- Instant refunds for cancellations per contract terms

### 2. NFT Property Representation
- Each rental property minted as a unique NFT
- Immutable property details and ownership records
- Fractional ownership capabilities
- Transferable and tradable property tokens

### 3. Reputation System
#### Host Reputation Tracking
- On-chain reputation score
- Transparent review mechanism
- Stake-based quality assurance
- Incentives for maintaining high-quality listings

#### Guest Reputation Management
- Verified booking history
- Trust score based on past interactions
- Penalty mechanisms for property damages
- Reputation-based booking privileges

### 4. IoT Integration
- Blockchain-verified smart locks
- Remote keyless entry
- Energy consumption monitoring
- Automated utility billing
- Security system integration

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- Blockchain: Ethereum/Polygon
- Smart Contracts: Solidity
- Frontend: React/Web3.js
- Backend: IPFS, The Graph
- IoT Protocol: MQTT, Chainlink Oracles

### System Workflow
1. Property NFT Minting
2. Listing Creation
3. Smart Contract Booking
4. IoT Device Verification
5. Automated Check-in/Check-out
6. Reputation Update

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- Ethereum Wallet
- Hardware: IoT-enabled Smart Lock
- Chainlink Node Setup

### Setup Commands
```bash
